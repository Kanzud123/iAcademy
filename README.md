Description:  This project is an online learning platform that offers a wide range of courses on various subjects. It is a marketplace where instructors can create and sell their courses, and learners can enroll in these courses to acquire new skills, gain knowledge, or pursue personal interests. On our website, students can take courses by logging in. After login, students can easily enroll in any course according to their needs and can make their profile in the My Profile Section, and can change their passwords if needed. Each course has user reviews and ratings that provide insights into the quality and effectiveness of the course. While some courses are available for free, most courses have a specific price attached to them, set by the instructor.
